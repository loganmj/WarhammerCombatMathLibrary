Number of attacks: $$(X)(Dy) + Z$$
where:
X is a scalar value representing the number of variable attack rolls.
Dy is the dice type (typically representing either a D3 or D6 die roll).
Z is the flat number of attacks that the unit gets in addition to any variable attacks.

Most weapons have a flat number of attacks, and do not have variable attacks. In this case, X can be considered 0.
This will make the equation resolve only to the flat number of attacks like so:

$$(0)(Dy) + Z = Z$$
